== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin have a coupon limit? =
This plugin works with an unlimited number of coupons.

= Why isn't my coupon auto-applying? =
The coupon will apply only when conditions are met.  This includes conditions in the WooCommerce coupon settings under Usage Restriction and Usage Limits.  For instance, the coupon expiration date (if set) must be in the future.

= How can I troubleshoot my coupons? =
To troubleshoot, you must be logged in as an administrator.  Visit the cart page and add /?troubleshoot to the URL in the address bar.  This will list all auto-apply coupons and the status.
