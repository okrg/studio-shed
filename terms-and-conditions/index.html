        form</a>, setting forth specifically the basis for the claim, and must include photographs of the defect(s).
      Failure to satisfy the requirements above shall constitute irrevocable acceptance of the Product. All warranty
      claim notices must be filled out <a href="https://studioshed.wufoo.com/forms/z6zbvqz02z5jol/" target="_blank">via
        online form here</a>. This warranty provides the Client specific legal rights. (Client may also have other

      (also known as Guide) or any related instructions or drawings, or any abuse or misuse of the Product including
      unauthorized alterations, shall immediately void this Limited Warranty. Studio Shed is not responsible for damage
      caused by the location of the Product on or over inappropriate soils or terrain, <span
        class="font-bold text-red-700" where manufacturer warranties are excluded or do not apply</span>, by the use of
      improper replacement parts, or acts of God. Studio Shed is not liable and expressly disclaims all liability for
      damages due to misuse, using the Product for other than what's specified in the Order or what's allowed by
      applicable codes, neglect, improper maintenance or adjustments, and normal wear and tear of the Product. Studio
      Shed also is not liable for damages related to use of an un-permitted unit when a permit is required. Studio Shed
      reserves the right to change and/or improve the design and/or specifications of the Product without notice or
      obligation to modify previously produced units. No or other instructions, advice, Product information, or
      marketing materials, whether oral or written, obtained by Client at any time from Studio Shed or any vendor or
      retailer of Studio Shed Product shall create any Studio Shed express warranty not expressly stated in this
      Section. </p>
    <p><strong>Studio Shed is not responsible for corrosion on any metal components </strong><strong>(e.g. metal roof,
      drip edge, metal trim, door hardware, etc.) </strong><strong>if Product is </strong><strong>closer than 1,100
      yards (5/8 mile) to any body of salt water.</strong></p>
    <p>STUDIO SHED MAKES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES EXCEPT AS STATED IN THIS SECTION. ANY AND ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
      WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, SHALL TERMINATE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE (365) DAYS FROM CLIENT'S RECEIPT OF THE PRODUCT. (SOME STATES DO
      NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO CLIENT.)</p>
    <h2>10. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
    <p>Client agrees to defend, with counsel approved by Studio Shed, all actions against Studio Shed, its officers,
      directors, managers, shareholders, members, employees, agents, beneficiaries, successors, and other

      arising from or relating to the injury to or death of any person, or damage to or loss of property, caused by or
      incurred in connection with Client's use or misuse of the Product.</p>
    <p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL STUDIO SHED BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOST
      BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
      ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR CLIENT'S PURCHASE OF PRODUCT (WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
      WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE, OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
      OTHER THEORY), EVEN IF STUDIO SHED HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL STUDIO
      SHED'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, OR TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
      OR IMPUTED, PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER THEORY, EXCEED THE PRICE PAID BY CLIENT TO STUDIO
      SHED.</p>
    <p>(Certain state laws do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply, some or all
      of the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to Client, and Client may have additional rights to those
      contained herein. In such states, Studio Shed's liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.)</p>

    <h2>15. NO WAIVER</h2>
    <p>No waiver of any provision of these terms and conditions or delay by either party in enforcement of any right
